# odin-recipes
Going to create a website that has a homepage which includes a list of breakfasts.
Each of the breakfast items will have a link attached to its name which will lead into the breakfasts recipe.
This recipe page also will contain a photo of the food, a small discrpition, and instructions.
This project will help introduce lists, links, and images in html.
